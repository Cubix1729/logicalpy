Then, you can clone your forked repository to your local computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/logicalpy.git
cd logicalpy
```

### 2. Set up your development environment

In order to contribute to the project, you will need to install it locally.

 - You can first optionally create a virtual environment
 - Then, locally install the project in editable mode with:
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

### 3. Make and commit your changes

Once your are ready, create a new branch, make your changes and commit them with
descriptive messages (preferably use the past tence).

`master` branch of the original repository. Provide a clear explanation of what you have done,
as well as any relevant context.

## Code style and testing guidelines

To meet the project's code style, please format the code with `black` using the command
`black <path-to-the-code>`. (The maximum line length used is the default one, i.e. 88 
characters).

If you implement any new feature or change an existing one, please update the tests in
consequence.

For any modification you make, ensure the tests still pass by running (from the main folder
or from the `tests` folder):

```
python -m unittest
```

to report it. Be sure to include:

 - A clear description of the bug
 - How to reproduce it
 - Expected and actual behaviour
 - The error message if there is one
 - The LogicalPy version used and your environment setup

You can also open an issue if you want to suggest a feature or if you have a question.
