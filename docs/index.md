LogicalPy is a small Python library providing basic functionalities for manipulating propositional logic.

## Description

The library allows to work with classical propositional logic formulae.
The main features include:

 - The creation of logical formulae either directly or from a string
 - The implementation of semantic notions: satisfiability, entailment...
 - The conversion to normal forms (NNF, DNF, DNF)
 - Automated theorem proving with the resolution procedure

## Installation

With pip:
```shell
pip install logicalpy
```

## Usage

For getting started, see the usage section.
